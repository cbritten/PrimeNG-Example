            <ul> 
                <li>Data Visualization Charts. These charts have many options included to allow the user to swtich the legends side and toggle the displayed values. 
                    The types of charts include: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Pie and Dougnhut Charts</li>
                        <li>Bar, Line, and Combo charts</li>
                        <li>Radar and Polar Area Charts</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Data Visualization Tables. There are two examples :
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The first example shows a larger dataset for an organization's clients. It has a ton of features to allow the user to switch row grouping type, filter different
                            columns based on the needs, allow global filtering, and some other features. It also showcases my abilities to add in many different PrimeNG components
                            to the table itself. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The second example is a minimal shopping experience. This table shows the user roughly 30 products and allows them to add them to their cart. Once
                            the product is in their cart, they can view the whole cart, adjust the item total, see their subtotal and cart total, see recommended items as well as 
                            add those to their cart. 
                        </li>
                    </ul>    
                </li>
                <li>
                    Landing Page Skillset and intro. These skills are kept in an array and will be updated as I continue my career as a software engineer.
